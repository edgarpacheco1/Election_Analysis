## Election-Audit Summary

**- A business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used for any election**

Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections:

1. For City Council Elections, that is, so that the population can vote for mayors, we could modify the program to include the candidates, get the number and percentage of votes by municipalities, cities, counties.

2.	It can be used to elect Governors in each state, in the same way as was done in this exercise we can obtain the number of votes and percentages for each candidate, information on votes can be obtained for each county and city and with this define winners and all their quantities.
